Python script for seeing how many dms you have sent on discord every day grouped by users you have talked to. Also has functionality for seeing how long you have spend in vc with different people every day, as well as some more stuff like searching for messages throughout all messages. Made for personal use so its kinda messy and some stuff doesnt work (like sorting by week). To use it you have to export all your messages with this tool: https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter
